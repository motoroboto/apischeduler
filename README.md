This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It tracks time by integrating with the moment.js API.
Each hour timeblock can have tasks and events added and with the quick click of the save button, they will be stored in localstorage so that the page can be closed and reopened and you will still be able to access your schedule. 
There is also a clear button so you can start your schedule over easily each day.
